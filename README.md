## Features

- Real-time link scanning for enhanced security.
- Machine learning-based link analysis for accurate detection.
- Customizable settings to tailor the app's behavior to your preferences.
- Supports both Android and iOS platforms.

## How it Works

Once installed, the Secure Link App allows you to scan links using your device's camera or by pasting the link manually. The app then utilizes machine learning models to analyze various factors such as URL structure, domain reputation, and content to determine the safety of the link.
